# College-Exercises-Projects
Dump of basic exercises and projects from college
As the description says, this place is used to save the small works I've done in college. I've done a lot more but I only upload exams or more meaningful works, otherwise it would be full of simple exercises testing how lists work, lol.
This, hopefully, can help me get an internship at one point, as it proves I've learned this languages, at least to a basic level.
